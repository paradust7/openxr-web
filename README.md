# openxr-web
OpenXR runtime powered by WebXR

Emscripten provides OpenGL/GLES support using WebGL. This library additionally provides OpenXR support using WebXR.

As of February 2024, this library is under heavy development, but not yet functional.

I am writing this library in parallel with Minetest VR (https://dustlabs.io/minetestvr.html).
